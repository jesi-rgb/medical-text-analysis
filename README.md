# MEDTEXT: Medical text analysis 

MEDTEXT is a tool built for developers working on NER taggers and other text-mining based proyects. It can generate comments automatically, comments that really don't exist. This allows for a seamless integration between the dataset generation and augmentation and the development of medical mining tools.
